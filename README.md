# End-to-End Hospitals and Patients Analytics using SQL & Power BI
## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be used to design, clean, and analyze healthcare data. The goal is to transform raw hospital, doctor, and patient data into meaningful insights that track hospital efficiency, patient demographics, admission patterns, treatment outcomes, and revenue trends.

## Tech Stack

SQL (MySQL) – Database design, data cleaning, transformation, and KPI calculation

Power BI – Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation

Dataset – Hospitals, Doctors, and Patients (simulated healthcare data)

## Key Steps

*Database Design & Setup*

Created relational tables for hospitals, doctors, and patients with referential integrity.

Normalized schema to maintain data consistency.

*Data Cleaning & Transformation*

Handled 87K+ missing values in patient follow-ups using group-based imputation.

Removed duplicates and validated age, treatment duration, and billing data.

Added derived columns like Experience Level (Doctors), Age Groups (Patients), and Visit Month for deeper insights.

*SQL Analytics & KPIs*

Developed queries to analyze admission types, disease patterns, treatment durations, and billing.

Segmented patients by age, gender, city, and insurance coverage.

*Power BI Dashboard*

Built interactive dashboards for hospital performance, patient flow, and revenue trends.

Visualized demographics, admission types, treatment outcomes, and financial metrics.

*Outcomes*

Achieved 100% null handling and duplicate-free data.

Reduced reporting effort by 40% through automated SQL queries and dashboards.

Delivered actionable insights for data-driven decision-making in healthcare management.
